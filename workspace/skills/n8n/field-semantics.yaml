# Semantic field rules for n8n workflow automation platform events.
#
# This file is read by the deterministic generateMapping pipeline —
# NOT by the conversational agent. It defines which fields are identifiers,
# which are dimensions, which are measures, and how they relate.
#
# Field names here MUST match what the n8n import route puts into event.state and event.labels.
# Source of truth for field names: src/app/api/connections/inventory/n8n/import/route.ts
#
# Schema validated by: mastra/lib/semantics/fieldSemantics.ts (Zod)
# Consumed by: mastra/tools/generateMapping.ts → applySemanticOverrides()
